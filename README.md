# Collarz
 Inkscape extension that generates paper model of a collar

Given a set of parameters for two polygons, this program generates paper models of (1) the two polygons; (2) a collar (divided into segments if desired) represented by a strip with tabs and score lines; and (3) wrapper(s) for covering the tabbed strip(s).

UPDATE: THIS EXTENSION IS CURRENTLY BROKEN UNDER VERSION 1.4. I HAVE PLACED A VERSION OF THIS EXTENSION THAT APPEARS TO WORK (BUT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY TESTED) IN THE beta FOLDER. I AM INTERESTED IN ANY PROBLEMS YOU FIND WITH IT AND HOW IT WORKS WITH VERSIONS 1.1 TO 1.3.

Installing:
 
Copy collarz.inx and collarz.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory.

Usage:

See the file [How_to_use_collarz.pdf](https://github.com/obzerving/Collarz/blob/main/How_to_use_collarz.pdf) for details.

Note:

This extension (for Inkscape version 1.1 to 1.3.) is functional, but not bulletproof, so be mindful of the input constraints in the usage document.
